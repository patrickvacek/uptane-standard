<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">Uptane is a secure software update framework for automobiles. This document describes procedures to enable programmers for OEMs and suppliers to design and implement this framework to better protect connected units on cars. Integrating Uptane as outlined in the sections that follow can reduce the ability of attackers to compromise critical systems. It also assures a faster and easier recovery process should a compromise occur.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">These instructions specify the components necessary for a compliant implementation. Individual implementors can make their own technological choices within those requirements. This flexibility makes Uptane adaptable to the many customized update solutions used by manufacturers.</p>

A car can have a number of buses that will vary in terms of power, speed and resources.<br> <em>Image</em>: File containing software for an ECU to install. May contain a binary image to flash, installation instructions, and other necessary information for the ECU to properly apply the update. Each ECU typically holds only one image, although this may vary in some cases.<br> <em>Primary/Secondary ECUs</em>: Terms used to describe the control units within an automobile. A primary ECU downloads from a repository and verifies update images and metadata for itself and for secondary ECUs, and distributes images and metadata to secondaries. Thus, it requires extra storage space and a connection to the internet. Secondary ECUs receive their update images and metadata from the primary, and only need to verify and install their own metadata and images.<br> <em>Repository</em>: A server containing metadata about images.

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>The number of connected units on the average vehicle continues to grow, with mainstream cars now containing up to 100 million lines of code. <a href="#USATODAY" class="xref">[USATODAY]</a>
</li>
<li>The expanded use of software over-the-air strategies creates new attack surfaces for malicious parties. <a href="#CR-OTA" class="xref">[CR-OTA]</a>
</li>
<li>Legacy update strategies, such as SSL/TLS or GPG/RSA, are not feasible for use on automotive ECUs because they force manufacturers to chose between enhanced security and customizability.</li>
<li>Conventional strategies are also complicated by the differing resources of the ECUs, which can vary greatly in memory, storage space, and Internet connectivity.</li>
<li>The design of Uptane makes it possible to offer improved design flexibility, without sacrificing security.</li>
<li>This added design flexibility, however, could be a liability if the framework is implemented incorrectly.</li>
<li>Standardization of crucial steps in the design, implementation and use of Uptane can assure that customizability does not impact security or functionality.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.5.2.3.1.p.1">At the very least, a targets metadata file MUST contain the <samp>TargetsMetadata.targets</samp> attribute, which specifies a sequence of unencrypted images. An empty sequence is used to indicate that no targets/images are available. For every unencrypted image, its filename, version number, length, and hashes are listed using the <samp>Target</samp> sequence.

The director repository cannot choose images for an ECU with a release counter that is lower than the release counter of the image it has currently installed. The <samp>Custom.hardwareIdentifier</samp> attribute is used to prevent a compromised director repository from causing ECUs to install images that were not intended for them.

<p id="rfc.section.5.2.3.1.p.3">The following attributes SHOULD be specified by the director repository. The <samp>Custom.ecuIdentifier</samp> attribute specifies the identifier (e.g., serial number) of the ECU that should install this image. An ECU SHOULD verify that each ECU identifier has been defined exactly once in the metadata file. If the director repository wishes to publish per-ECU encrypted images, then the <samp>Custom.encryptedTarget</samp> attribute MAY be used to specify metadata about the encrypted images. An ECU MUST then download the encrypted image, check its metadata, decrypt the image, and check its metadata again. Finally, if an ECU key is an asymmetric public key, the director repository MAY use a <em>symmetric</em> private key to reduce the time used to decrypt the image. To do so, the director repository MAY use the <em>asymmetric</em> ECU key to encrypt, e.g., a private AES symmetric key, and place the encrypted key in the <samp>Custom.encryptedSymmetricKey</samp> attribute.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.2.3.2.p.1">Besides directly signing metadata about images, the targets role MAY delegate this responsibility to delegated targets roles.

<p id="rfc.section.5.2.3.2.p.2">The <samp>TargetsDelegations.keys</samp> attribute lists all of the public keys used by the delegated targets roles in the current targets metadata file.

<p id="rfc.section.5.2.3.2.p.3">The <samp>TargetsDelegations.delegations</samp> attribute lists all of the delegations in the current targets metadata file.  All delegations are prioritized: a sequence is used to list delegations in order of appearance, so that the earlier the appearance of a delegation, the higher its priority. Every delegation contains three important attributes.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.3.2.p.4">The <samp>PathsToRoles.paths</samp> attribute describes a sequence of target/image paths that the delegated roles are trusted to provide. A desired target/image needs to match only one of these paths for the delegation to apply. A path MAY be either to a single file, or to a directory to indicate all files and / or subdirectories under that directory. A path to a directory is used to indicate all possible targets sharing that directory as a prefix; e.g. if the directory is &#8220;targets/A,&#8221; then targets which match that directory include &#8220;targets/A/B.img&#8221; and &#8220;targets/A/B/C.img.&#8221;</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.3.2.p.5">The <samp>PathsToRoles.roles</samp> attribute describes all of the roles that SHALL sign the same non-custom metadata (i.e., filename, length, and hashes of unencrypted images) about delegated targets/images. Every delegated targets role has (1) a name, (2) a set of public keys, and (3) a threshold of these keys required to verify its metadata file.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.3.2.p.6">Note that a role name SHOULD follow the filename restrictions of the underlying file storage mechanism. For example, it may be &#8220;director&#8221; or &#8220;targets/director.&#8221; As discussed in Section 3.7, the role name will determine part of the actual metadata filename of the delegated targets role. If it is &#8220;director&#8221; or &#8220;targets/director,&#8221; then its delegated targets metadata file MAY use the filename &#8220;director.ext&#8221; or &#8220;targets/director.ext,&#8221; respectively. However, the role name SHALL NOT use the path separator (e.g., &#8220;/&#8221; or &#8220;\&#8221;) if it is a character used to separate directories on the underlying file storage mechanism. In other words, all targets metadata files are implicitly assumed to reside in the same directory. It is safe to use this character in key-value databases or stores that do not have a notion of directories (e.g., Amazon S3).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.3.2.p.7">Finally, the <samp>PathsToRoles.terminating</samp> attribute determines whether or not a backtracking search for a target/image should be terminated.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.2.7.p.1">There is a difference between the file name in a metadata file or an ECU, and the file name on a repository. This difference exists in order to avoid race conditions, where metadata and images are read from and written to at the same time. For more details, the reader should read the TUF specification <a href="#TUF-spec" class="xref">[TUF-spec]</a> and PEP 458 <a href="#PEP-458" class="xref">[PEP-458]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.7.p.2">Unless stated otherwise, all metadata files SHALL be written as such to a repository. If a metadata file A was specified as FILENAME.EXT in another metadata file B, then it SHALL be written as VERSION.FILENAME.EXT where VERSION is A&#8217;s version number <a href="#common_metadata" class="xref">Section 5.2.1</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.7.p.3">For example, if the top-level targets metadata file is referenced as &#8220;targets.json&#8221; in the snapshot metadata file, it is read and written using the filename &#8220;1.targets.json&#8221; instead. In a similar example, if the snapshot metadata file is referenced as &#8220;snapshot.json&#8221; in the timestamp metadata file, it is read and written using the filename &#8220;1.snapshot.json&#8221; instead. To take a final example using delegations (Section 3.4.2), if the ROLENAME of a delegated targets metadata file is &#8220;director,&#8221; and it is referred to in the snapshot metadata file using the filename &#8220;director.json&#8221; and the version number 42, then it is read and written using the filename &#8220;42.director.json&#8221; instead.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.7.p.4">There are two exceptions to this rule. First, if the version number of the timestamp metadata is not known in advance, it MAY also be read from and written to a repository using a filename that is not qualified with a version number (i.e., FILENAME.EXT). As we will see in <a href="#director_repository" class="xref">Section 5.3.2</a>, this is the case with the timestamp metadata file on the image repository, but not the director repository. Second, the root metadata SHALL also be read from and written to a repository using a filename that is not qualified with a version number (i.e., FILENAME.EXT). This is because, as we will see in <a href="#metadata_verification" class="xref">Section 5.4.4</a>, the root metadata may be read without knowing its version number in advance.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.7.p.5">All target files are written as such to a repository. If a target&#8217;s metadata file specifies a target file as FILENAME.EXT then it SHALL be written as HASH.FILENAME.EXT where HASH is one of the n hashes of the targets file <a href="#targets_meta" class="xref">Section 5.2.3</a>. This means that there SHALL be n different file names that all point to the same target file. Each filename is distinguished only by the value of the digest in its filename.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.7.p.6">However, note that although a primary SHALL download a metadata or target file using the filename written to the repository, it SHALL write the file to its own storage using the original filename in the metadata. For example, if a metadata file is referred to as FILENAME.EXT in another metadata file, then a primary SHALL download it using either the filename FILENAME.EXT, VERSION.FILENAME.EXT, or HASH.FILENAME.EXT (depending on which of the aforementioned rules applies), but it SHALL always write it to its own storage as FILENAME.EXT. This implies that the previous set of metadata and target files downloaded from a repository SHALL be kept in a separate directory on an ECU from the latest set of files.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.7.p.7">For example, the previous set of metadata and target files MAY be kept in the &#8220;previous&#8221; directory on an ECU, whereas the latest set of files MAY be kept in the &#8220;current&#8221; directory.</p>

<li>When the Director receives a vehicle version manifest sent by a primary (as described in <a href="#construct_manifest_primary" class="xref">Section 5.4.2.1</a>), it decodes the manifest, and determines the unique vehicle identifier.</li>
<li>Using the vehicle identifier, the Director queries its inventory database (as described in <a href="#inventory_db" class="xref">Section 5.3.2.2</a>) for relevant information about each ECU in the vehicle.</li>
<li>The Director checks the manifest for accuracy compared to the information in the inventory database. If any of the required checks fail, the Director drops the request. An implementor MAY make whatever additional checks they wish. At a minimum, the following checks are required: <ul>
<li>Each ECU recorded in the inventory database is also represented in the manifest.</li>
<li>The signature of the manifest matches the ECU key of the primary that sent it.</li>
<li>The signature of each secondary&#8217;s contribution to the manifest matches the ECU key of that secondary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Director extracts information about currently installed images from the vehicle version manifest. Using this information, it determines if the vehicle is already up-to-date, and if not, determines a set of images that should be installed. The exact process by which this determination takes place is out of scope of this standard. However, it MUST take into account <em>dependencies</em> and <em>conflicts</em> between images, and SHOULD consult well-established techniques for dependency resolution.</li>
<li>The Director MAY encrypt images for ECUs that require it.</li>
<li>The Director generates new metadata representing the desired set of images to be installed in the vehicle, based on the dependency resolution in step 4.

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.4.2.p.1">Full verification of metadata means that the ECU checks that the targets metadata about images from the director repository matches the targets metadata about the same images from the image repository. This provides resilience to a key compromise in the system.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.4.2.p.2">Full verification MAY be performed either by primary or secondary ECUs. The procedure is the same, except that secondary ECUs receive their metadata from the primary instead of downloading it directly. In the following instructions, whenever an ECU is directed to download metadata, it applies only to primary ECUs.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.4.2.p.3">A primary ECU SHALL download metadata and images following the rules specified in <a href="#TAP-5" class="xref">[TAP-5]</a>, and the metadata file renaming rules specified in <a href="#metadata_filename_rules" class="xref">Section 5.2.7</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.4.2.p.4">In order to perform full verification, an ECU SHALL perform the following steps:</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Load the map file <a href="#TAP-4" class="xref">[TAP-4]</a>. If necessary, use the information therein to determine where to download metadata from.</li>
<li>Load the latest attested time from the time server.</li>
<li>Download and check the root metadata file from the director repository: <ol>
<li>Load the previous root metadata file.</li>
<li>Update to the latest root metadata file.</li>
<li>Let N denote the version number of the latest root metadata file (which at first could be the same as the previous root metadata file).</li>
<li>Try downloading a new version N+1 of the root metadata file, up to some X number of bytes. The value for X is set by the implementor. For example, X may be tens of kilobytes. The filename used to download the root metadata file is of the fixed form VERSION_NUMBER.FILENAME.EXT (e.g., 42.root.json). If this file is not available, then go to step 3.5.</li>
<li>Version N+1 of the root metadata file MUST have been signed by: (1) a threshold of keys specified in the latest root metadata file (version N), and (2) a threshold of keys specified in the new root metadata file being validated (version N+1). If version N+1 is not signed as required, discard it, abort the update cycle, and report the signature failure. On the next update cycle, begin at step 0 and version N of the root metadata file. (Checks for an arbitrary software attack.)</li>
<li>The version number of the latest root metadata file (version N) must be less than or equal to the version number of the new root metadata file (version N+1). Effectively, this means checking that the version number signed in the new root metadata file is indeed N+1. If the version of the new root metadata file is less than the latest metadata file, discard it, abort the update cycle, and report the rollback attack. On the next update cycle, begin at step 0 and version N of the root metadata file. (Checks for a rollback attack.)</li>
<li>Set the latest root metadata file to the new root metadata file.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1 to 6.</li>
<li>Check that the latest attested time is lower than the expiration timestamp in the latest root metadata file. (Checks for a freeze attack.)</li>
<li>If the the timestamp and / or snapshot keys have been rotated, delete the previous timestamp and snapshot metadata files. (Checks for recovery from fast-forward attacks <a href="#MERCURY" class="xref">[MERCURY]</a>.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Download and check the timestamp metadata file from the director repository: <ol>
<li>Download up to Y number of bytes. The value for Y is set by the implementor. For example, Y may be tens of kilobytes. The filename used to download the timestamp metadata file is of the fixed form FILENAME.EXT (e.g., timestamp.json).</li>
<li>Check that it has been signed by the threshold of keys specified in the latest root metadata file. If the new timestamp metadata file is not properly signed, discard it, abort the update cycle, and report the signature failure. (Checks for an arbitrary software attack.)</li>
<li>Check that the version number of the previous timestamp metadata file, if any, is less than or equal to the version number of this timestamp metadata file. If the new timestamp metadata file is older than the trusted timestamp metadata file, discard it, abort the update cycle, and report the potential rollback attack. (Checks for a rollback attack.)</li>
<li>Check that the latest attested time is lower than the expiration timestamp in this timestamp metadata file. If the new timestamp metadata file has expired, discard it, abort the update cycle, and report the potential freeze attack. (Checks for a freeze attack.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Download and check the snapshot metadata file from the director repository: <ol>
<li>Download up to the number of bytes specified in the timestamp metadata file. If consistent snapshots are not used <a href="#metadata_filename_rules" class="xref">Section 5.2.7</a>, then the filename used to download the snapshot metadata file is of the fixed form FILENAME.EXT (e.g., snapshot.json). Otherwise, the filename is of the form VERSION_NUMBER.FILENAME.EXT (e.g., 42.snapshot.json), where VERSION_NUMBER is the version number of the snapshot metadata file listed in the timestamp metadata file. In either case, the ECU MUST write the file to non-volatile storage as FILENAME.EXT.</li>
<li>The hashes and version number of the new snapshot metadata file MUST match the hashes and version number listed in timestamp metadata. If hashes and version do not match, discard the new snapshot metadata, abort the update cycle, and report the failure. (Checks for a mix-and-match attack.)</li>
<li>Check that it has been signed by the threshold of keys specified in the latest root metadata file. If the new snapshot metadata file is not signed as required, discard it, abort the update cycle, and report the signature failure. (Checks for an arbitrary software attack.)</li>
<li>Check that the version number of the previous snapshot metadata file, if any, is less than or equal to the version number of this snapshot metadata file. If this snapshot metadata file is older than the previous snapshot metadata file, discard it, abort the update cycle, and report the potential rollback attack. (Checks for a rollback attack.)</li>
<li>Check that the version number the previous snapshot metadata file lists for each targets metadata file is less than or equal to the its version number in this snapshot metadata file. If this condition is not met, discard the new snaphot metadadata file, abort the update cycle, and report the failure. (Checks for a rollback attack.)</li>
<li>Check that each targets metadata filename listed in the previous snapshot metadata file is also listed in this snapshot metadata file. If this condition is not met, discard the new snaphot metadadata file, abort the update cycle, and report the failure. (Checks for a rollback attack.)</li>
<li>Check that the latest attested time is lower than the expiration timestamp in this snapshot metadata file. If the new snapshot metadata file is expired, discard it, abort the update cycle, and report the potential freeze attack. (Checks for a freeze attack.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Download and check the targets metadata file from the director repository: <ol>
<li>Download up to either the number of bytes specified in the snapshot metadata file, or some Z number of bytes. The value for Z is set by the implementor. For example, Z may be tens of kilobytes. If consistent snapshots are not used <a href="#metadata_filename_rules" class="xref">Section 5.2.7</a>, then the filename used to download the targets metadata file is of the fixed form FILENAME.EXT (e.g., targets.json). Otherwise, the filename is of the form VERSION_NUMBER.FILENAME.EXT (e.g., 42.targets.json), where VERSION_NUMBER is the version number of the targets metadata file listed in the snapshot metadata file. In either case, the ECU MUST write the file to non-volatile storage as FILENAME.EXT.</li>
<li>The hashes (if any), and version number of the new targets metadata file MUST match the latest snapshot metadata. If the new targets metadata file does not match, discard it, abort the update cycle, and report the failure. (Checks for a mix-and-match attack.)</li>
<li>Check that it has been signed by the threshold of keys specified in the latest root metadata file. (Checks for an arbitrary software attack.)</li>
<li>Check that the version number of the previous targets metadata file, if any, is less than or equal to the version number of this targets metadata file. (Checks for a rollback attack.)</li>
<li>Check that the latest attested time is lower than the expiration timestamp in this targets metadata file. (Checks for a freeze attack.)</li>
<li>Check that there are no delegations. (Targets metadata from the director MUST NOT contain delegations.)</li>
<li>Check that no ECU identifier is represented more than once.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Download and check the root metadata file from the image repository as in Step 3.</li>
<li>Download and check the timestamp metadata file from the image repository as in Step 4.</li>
<li>Download and check the snapshot metadata file from the image repository as in Step 5.</li>
<li>Download and check the top-level targets metadata file from the image repository as in Step 6 (except for Steps 6.6-6.7).</li>
<li>For each image listed in the targets metadata file from the director repository, locate a targets metadata file that contains an image with exactly the same file name. For each delegated targets metadata file that is found to contain metadata for the image currently being processed, perform all of the checks in step 10. Use the following process to locate image metadata: <ol>
<li>If the top-level targets metadata file contains signed metadata about the image, return the metadata to be checked and skip to step 11.3.</li>
<li>Recursively search the list of delegations, in order of appearance: <ol>
<li>If it is a multi-role delegation <a href="#TAP-3" class="xref">[TAP-3]</a>, recursively visit each role, and check that each has signed exactly the same non-custom metadata (i.e., length and hashes) about the image. If it is all the same, return the metadata to be checked and skip to step 11.3.</li>
<li>If it is a terminating delegation and it contains signed metadata about the image, return the metadata to be checked and skip to step 11.3. If metadata about an image is not found in a terminating delegation, return an error code indicating that the image is missing.</li>
<li>Otherwise, continue processing the next delegation, if any. As soon as a delegation is found that contains signed metadata about the image, return the metadata to be checked and skip to step 11.3.</li>
<li>If no signed metadata about the image can be found anywhere in the delegation graph, return an error code indicating that the image is missing.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Check that the targets metadata from the image repository matches the targets metadata from the director repository: <ol>
<li>Check that the non-custom metadata (i.e., length and hashes) of the unencrypted image are the same in both sets of metadata.</li>
<li>Check that the custom metadata (e.g., hardware identifier and release counter) are the same in both sets of metadata.</li>
<li>Check that the release counter in the previous targets metadata file is less than or equal to the release counter in this targets metadata file.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Verify the desired image against its targets metadata.</li>
<li>If there is no targets metadata about this image, abort the update cycle and report that there is no such image.</li>
<li>Otherwise, download the image (up to the number of bytes specified in the targets metadata), and verify that its hashes match the targets metadata. (We download up to this number of bytes, because in some cases, the exact number is unknown. This may happen, for example, if an external program is used to compute the root hash of a tree of targets files, and this program does not provide the total size of all of these files.) If consistent snapshots are not used <a href="#metadata_filename_rules" class="xref">Section 5.2.7</a>, then the filename used to download the image file is of the fixed form FILENAME.EXT (e.g., foobar.tar.gz). Otherwise, the filename is of the form HASH.FILENAME.EXT (e.g., c14aeb4ac9f4a8fc0d83d12482b9197452f6adf3eb710e3b1e2b79e8d14cb681.foobar.tar.gz), where HASH is one of the hashes of the targets file listed in the targets metadata file found earlier in step 4. In either case, the client MUST write the file to non-volatile storage as FILENAME.EXT.</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.4.2.p.6">If any step fails, the ECU MUST return an error code indicating the failure. If a check for a specific type of security attack fails (e.g. rollback, freeze, arbitrary software, etc.), the ECU SHOULD return an error code that indicates the type of attack.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.4.2.p.7">If the ECU performing the verification is the primary ECU, it SHOULD also ensure that the ECU identifiers present in the targets metadata from the director repository are a subset of the actual ECU identifiers of ECUs in the vehicle.</p>
